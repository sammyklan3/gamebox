        <div class="about">
            <p>The objective of the game remains the same as its Java and Legacy Console editions counterparts, where
                players can build virtual realities in a sandbox-like environment. Like its counterparts, Pocket Edition
                also has survival elements present in other versions of the game such as brewing, hunger, and dimensions
                like the Nether and the End. The multiplayer mode is cross-platform compatible between all touch-screen
                devices capable of running Pocket Edition.

                The HUD and other elements are adapted to mobile standards of gameplay. Interactions are made via
                touchscreen (both the iOS and Android versions of Pocket Edition have the same gameplay). To comply with
                the disadvantages of touchscreen gameplay, several features were revised. For instance, the crafting
                system uses the MATTIS system and items are disposed of by long-tapping their icon on the toolbar. For
                better visibility on mobile screens, blocks being aimed at are highlighted rather than outlined. Unlike
                mobile's crafting menu, Windows 10 edition's crafting menu is similar to Java and Console crafting menu.
                The game was released with graphics akin to that of Java Edition Alpha (bright green grass blocks, old
                cobblestone texture, etc.), but as of v0.8.0, graphics have become equivalent to the Java Edition but
                also including light tinting and shading affected by the sun's position. Differences from the Java
                Edition include:..
                Through Pocket Realms. Pocket Realms was closed in v0.7.6 and now newly available again in Alpha
                v0.15.0.
                Through a user-created external server.
                Through Xbox Live.</p>
